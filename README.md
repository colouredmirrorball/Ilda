Ilda
====

A Processing library which renders Ilda files.
Work in progress. As of right now you can do some simple things.

Alpha release (largely works but has some bugs): https://github.com/colouredmirrorball/Ilda/releases/tag/v0.0.3-alpha

Javadoc: http://colouredmirrorball.github.io/Ilda/


How to install:

 * Download Processing from processing.org if you haven't already (latest version should work, if not file an issue)
 * Unzip and run it at least once
 * Find the sketch path: File >> Settings >> Sketchpath
 * Use a file browser and open this path
 * Create or open the folder "libraries"
 * Unzip Ilda.jar in this directory
 * Should now look like this: *Sketchpath*\libraries\Ilda\library\Ilda.jar
 * Open an exampleor get coding! Good luck!
